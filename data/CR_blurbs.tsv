campaign	episode	summary
1	1	Vox Machina arrives at the cavernous underground city of Kraghammer intent on rescuing a missing halfling paladin. They sample the culture of the city and find themselves coming face-to-face with the horrors coming from beneath the city...
1	2	Vox Machina makes a deal with Nostoc Greyspine to put an end to the darkness now rising up from the bowels of the earth. The party gears up and makes their way into Kraghammer's mine, beginning a miles-long trek down into the veins of Khaloor.
1	3	After saving Grog, the party comes across a duergar war camp controlled by a mind flayer. After a failed initial attack, Vex'ahlia and Keyleth find a powerful and unlikely ally.
1	4	Vox Machina forms a tentative alliance with an illithid outcast, named Clarota, deep inside the caverns under Kraghammer. The heroes devise a plan and fly themselves down to the center of the enemy's war camp to chance a risky assassination attempt on a creature that could easily break their wills with a glance.
1	5	Having successfully slain a dangerous illithid and its dwarven general, Vox Machina finds themselves surrounded by a small army of duergar. Barely escaping with their lives, they press forward, quickly realizing their path is growing more dangerous with every step into the darkness.
1	6	Vox Machina and Clarota continue to wind their way ever downward, eventually reaching the duergar fortress of Emberhold. With a little dash of gnomic derring-do, the group sneaks in through a secret entrance to begin searching for the captive Lady Kima of Vord.
1	7	With an uneasy agreement struck between Lady Kima of Vord and Clarota, Vox Machina quietly begins a search of Emberhold. Lady Kima means to strike a blow against their unseen enemy by cutting off the head of K'Varn's military forces, but the ensuing battle may come at a price...
1	8	Vox Machina, broken and battered, struggles to survive after a catastrophic battle with the duergar king and queen. Relying on Vex'ahlia's knowledge of the Underdark and her skill at tracking prey, the weary adventurers press on into the depths only to come across a perilous sea of bone and glass...
1	9	Vox Machina battles the duergar queen, Ulara, before she can make a thrall of Grog. Keyleth and Lady Kima settle their differences, Vax'ildan encourages the druid that she is not alone, and the party makes their way to the illithid colony of Yug'Voril.
1	10	After encountering a menagerie of trouble, Vox Machina looks into a cavern alcove and discovers the veil between planes that K'Varn stepped through to gain entrance to Yug'Voril. Making their way forward, Keyleth performs a Scrying ritual on the being himself, and discovers his true identity...
1	11	Vox Machina and their allies commence their assault on K'Varn's temple. Who will survive this grueling battle?
1	12	Matt Mercer relays some tips for playing and dungeon-mastering Dungeons & Dragons and then leads Vox Moronica through a one-shot adventure.
1	13	With K'Varn killed and the dread god Orcus's machinations put to an end, the party struggles with what to do next. Before a decision can be reached, several illithid glide into the chamber of the elder brain, and victory quickly yields to impending doom as Vox Machina struggles to escape the city alive...
1	14	After allowing themselves a single night's rest back in the city of Emon, the members of Vox Machina set out for their meeting with Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II and the Tal'Dorei Council. Once the Council learns of the Horn of Orcus, a course of action is eventually decided upon, and the party then heads out into the city to gear up for the mission at hand.
1	15	With the arrival of the envoys of Bahamut and the holy container in which to transport the evil Horn of Orcus, Vox Machina prepares to travel to the distant and ancient city of Vasselheim.
1	16	As Vox Machina completes the journey across the Ozmit Sea, Lady Kima of Vord arrives and prepares the group for the culture shock awaiting them in Othanzia's capital city of Vasselheim.
1	17	Parting ways with one of their members, Vox Machina is now adrift in a strange and unfamiliar city. After Grog dukes it out in a fighting pit, Vox Machina rushes to help against an attacking beast outside the city, which ends up setting a chain of events in motion.
1	18	With Vox Machina now split, Scanlan, Percy, Vex'ahlia, and Grog find themselves teaming up with an unlikely duo assigned by Huntmaster Vanessa Cyndrial of the Slayer's Take guild. The task at hand: ridding the wilds around Vasselheim of a troublesome white dragon past the frost-harried north of the Vesper Timberland...
1	19	Scanlan, Percy, Vex, and Grog continue their quest with Lyra and Zahra to hunt a white dragon for the Slayer's Take guild. Rimefang, an adult dragon, was pursued by a previous band of veteran adventurers from the guild—but they never returned! Is this a suicide mission or a true test of will?
1	20	Like their companions before them, Keyleth, Vax'ildan, and Tiberius begin their contract for the Slayer's Take along with a driven and mysterious young cleric named Kashaw and a hardened dwarf by the name of Thorbir. The group's mission—to track down and kill an elusive rakshasa that has been preying on wealthy travelers within the city—leads to the Velvet Cabaret, an exotic establishment in the Duskmeadow District...
1	21	Keyleth, Vax'ildan, and Tiberius, joined by Kashaw and Thorbir from the Slayer's Take, make their way down into the tunnels beneath the Velvet Cabaret, pursuing their mercurial prey. The path is far from easy, but after surmounting a handful of harrowing obstacles, Thorbir leads the hunting party into the hidden lair of the elusive rakshasa...
1	22	With their trials behind them, the members of Vox Machina reunite within the walls of the Slayer's Take. Newly marked and happily reunited, the group decides to set out for Pyrah to find the Fire Ashari, escorting Keyleth on the next leg of her Aramenté.
1	23	As Vox Machina prepares for the return to Emon, Grog demands a rematch against Kern to regain his honor. After some final errands, the party returns home to Greyskull Keep and a fan outside their home, but there's no time to rest with bad news on the horizon...
1	24	With the Briarwoods coming to Emon, Percy reveals the full tale of how they slaughtered his family and seized control of Whitestone. Vox Machina has just one week to prepare for a diplomatic feast between the Tal'Dorei Council and the sinister and mysterious Lord and Lady Briarwood...
1	25	Vax finds himself alone in the clutches of the villainous Briarwoods! While the team rushes in to save him, they are joined by a mysterious tiefling named Lillith, a powerful wizard on the run from bounty hunters. Can Vox Machina save both Vax and Lillith from their grim fates?
1	26	Reeling from the aftermath of their battle against the Briarwoods, Vox Machina is called before Sovereign Uriel Tal'Dorei II to answer for their recent destructive behavior. Seeking to bolster their reputation, the group agrees to hunt a mysterious giant bird terrorizing the countryside, with some rather interesting results...

1	34	Descending deeper beneath the city of Whitestone, the weary members of Vox Machina are on a collision course with the Briarwoods and their insidious plot. What secrets lie far below and what dangers still await our heroes?
1	35	In the wake of the fateful battle in the Ziggurat, Vox Machina comes face-to-face with the inner demons within Percy both literal and personal. As the Whitestone Rebellion comes to a head, can the party save Percy from the darkness within him? Or is he beyond saving?
1	36	The Winter's Crest Festival comes to Whitestone for the first time in five years! Seeing this as a chance to relax after the revolution, Vox Machina partakes in the festivities and exchanges gifts with each other as they enjoy a well-deserved moment of peace.
1	37	Vox Machina returns to Emon to prove their innocence. Now on the hunt for the treacherous Riskel Daxio, they must once again face the Clasp, along with some shady characters from Scanlan's past.
1	38	Vox Machina takes some well-earned downtime! Scanlan continues his dance with the mysterious gnome girl, Kaylie, and the group agrees to venture back to a mysterious cavern they had abandoned years before...
1	39	Vox Machina returns to General Krieg's home, learning about J'mon Sa Ord, ruler of Ank'Harel on the desert continent of Marquet. The group discovers a mysterious skull, and Vax questions the priorities of the group. Meanwhile, the city of Emon experiences a substantial political shift.
1	40	Vox Machina must deal with the Chroma Conclave's attack on Emon and the possible slaughter of much of the city's leadership and notable citizenry.
1	41	Vox Machina searches the ruins of Emon for survivors of the Chroma Conclave's attack. With the help of a new friend, they find an old one on death's door.
1	42	Vox Machina, having rescued Gilmore and the surviving members of the Tal'Dorei royal family, must decide how to handle the Chroma Conclave's attacks across Exandria—and whether to make a devil's bargain with the Clasp.
1	43	Now in the relative safety of Vasselheim, Vox Machina begins planning their first move against the Chroma Conclave. Fortunately, some old friends turn up to offer their aid.
1	44	In hopes of defeating the Chroma Conclave, Vox Machina sets out to recover the Vestiges of the Divergence—ancient armor, weapons, and other items of immense power. They learn the location of one Vestige, the Deathwalker's Ward, interred with an ancient Champion of the Raven Queen... at the bottom of a lake.
1	45	An exhausted Vox Machina spends some time hashing out their pent-up frustrations and examining their spoils of victory. They then journey to Pyrah, home of the Fire Ashari, hoping to find survivors of Thordak's escape from the Elemental Plane of Fire.
1	46	With fire elementals emerging from the Elemental Plane of Fire, Vox Machina joins forces with the druids of Pyrah and Zephrah—and a strange scavenger—to seal the rift between planes.
1	47	Vox Machina returns to where much of the group's history began: Westruun. But all is not well! Not only has the Chroma Conclave decimated the area, but another strangely familiar threat has taken hold of the city, as well...
1	48	Vox Machina continues the quest to collect the Vestiges of the Divergence in order to defeat the Chroma Conclave. Along the way, they are rejoined by Pike and discover some other old friends in dire straits.
1	49	Vox Machina ventures deep beneath the Stormcrest Mountains to confront the mysterious androsphinx mate of Osysa—and hopefully learn more about the Vestiges of the Divergence.
1	50	Vox Machina confronts the darkness of Craven Edge and plans to retake Westruun. Scanlan infiltrates the city to set up a distraction and stumbles upon some old friends.
1	51	Scanlan tries to plan a safe escape for his daughter Kaylie, while Grog makes his way to the center of Westruun for the final confrontation with his uncle Kevdak.
1	52	Unable to defeat Kevdak in single combat, Grog calls upon Vox Machina in a desperate fight for their lives, the fate of Westruun, and control of the Herd of Storms.
1	53	Vox Machina must decide: leave Westruun to fight another day, or prepare to face the deadly black dragon Umbrasyl?
1	54	With battle plans in place, Grog frees some Westruun citizens while Vox Machina busily prepares to engage Umbrasyl with the cunning of their tactics and the strength of the Herd of Storms. The hour arrives, Umbrasyl descends, and the battle begins...
1	55	The battle with Umbrasyl went according to plan—until it didn't. After most of the Herd of Storms dissolved in acid, and with Scanlan and Vax'ildan trapped inside the dragon with Grog trailing through the air on a chain, Vox Machina's chance for victory is about to fly away...
1	56	As the citizens of Westruun learn of Umbrasyl's demise, they must decide whether to flee possible retaliation from the Chroma Conclave or reclaim their city. With the burden of so many lives and so much destruction, the members of Vox Machina struggle with their own responsibilities and destinies. Perhaps a humble paladin can restore the hope of both frightened citizens and powerful heroes...
1	57	With Umbrasyl defeated, the Herd of Storms beginning a new chapter as part of the Rivermaw Tribe, and the city of Westruun restored to its people, Vox Machina journeys to Vasselheim as Vax'ildan confronts the heavy price of a bargain for his sister's life. After a short stay in Vasselheim, the party travels to Whitestone to meet old friends... and an old enemy?
1	58	Beset by an old foe disguised as a beloved ally, Vax fights for his life while the other members of Vox Machina fend off some assassin hirelings standing between them and their friend.
1	59	In search of one of the Vestiges of the Divergence, Vox Machina enters the Feywild—a magical but dangerous twilight reflection of the Material Plane. After finding a nymph from their past and a mischievous satyr, the party finds its way to a familiar place: the home of Vax and Vex's father, the elven city of Syngorn.
1	60	Forced by circumstance to enter Syngorn, the party reluctantly seeks audience with Vax'ildan and Vex'ahlia's estranged father, Syldor Vessar, and his new family. After a tense reunion, Vox Machina acquires diplomatic papers to pursue their agenda in the elven city—and complete some unscrupulous tasks for their satyr guide.
1	61	The satyr guide, Garmelie, leads Vox Machina toward the cancerous tree that houses one of the Vestiges of the Divergence. The journey through the Feywild presents several challenges, but the biggest and scariest threats aren't always the most dangerous in this strange realm...
1	62	Still travelling through the Feywild, Vox Machina and Garmelie finally arrive at the Gilded Run, a series of rivers that separate them from the Shademurk Bog. Nature itself bars passage, and even if they contend with the magical rivers, who knows what lurks below?
1	63	The members of Vox Machina prepare for their final approach to the cancerous tree in the Feywild, including a discussion between Keyleth and, seemingly, the bog itself. The tree opens to them, and Vex'ahlia is offered a disturbing choice...
1	64	Back in Whitestone to debate their next move, Vox Machina discovers their return from the Feywild may not have been as clean cut as it seemed. Their attention turns to Draconia where the destruction wrought by the Conclave again leaves the party to search for allies amongst the scattered survivors while coming face to face with the cost to defeat them.
1	65	Vox Machina travels to Marquet in search of Cabal's Ruin, the next Vestige on their list. They explore the city of Ank'Harel, get involved in some questionable activities, and eventually find themselves standing before the mysterious ruler of the city...
1	66	After proving their strength to J'mon Sa Ord, Vox Machina heads to a casino to have some fun and make some deals. The next day, they go in search of Mistress Asharru—the owner of Cabal's Ruin—and discover a shocking scene, as well as evidence that an old foe is on the move.
1	67	Anna Ripley has stolen one of the Vestiges of the Divergence and is on her way to an island of glass in search of another. With the help of Captain Damon and his skyship, Vox Machina races across the sea to stop her once and for all.
1	68	Hot on the heels of Dr. Anna Ripley, Vox Machina finds themselves on the beach of the isle of glass. The party prepares as their confrontation with Ripley draws near. Old demons and new discoveries will surface on the isle of Glintshore.
1	69	Vox Machina is left shaken in the aftermath of their battle with Anna Ripley. They hurry back to Whitestone to save one of their own and end up being offered an alliance from the most unlikely source...
1	70	After a tense discussion, Vox Machina finds themselves with an unlikely—and untrustworthy—ally. A risky plan is formed and the group heads to the ruins of Draconia to prepare for their battle with Vorugal the white dragon...
1	71	Vox Machina enacts their riskiest plan yet: summon a goristro from the Abyss to fight Vorugal and hope for the two giant creatures to kill each other. If they succeed, another member of the Chroma Conclave will fall and another Vestige will be retrieved. But if any step in their plan fails, it could have dire consequences, especially with another dragon waiting in the wings...
1	72	Fresh off of slaying Yenk and Vorugal the Frigid Doom, the weary members of Vox Machina take time to catch their breaths and set about gathering what spoils they could find from both the corpse of the wyrm and his treasure trove before resting and returning to Whitestone for their next course of action...
1	73	With three of the five members of the Chroma Conclave dead, Vox Machina has a meeting with their friends in Whitestone to begin planning for the upcoming battle with Thordak. Percy decides it's time for one of their allies to stop keeping secrets from the rest.
1	74	Vox Machina heads to Fort Daxio to begin preparation for the upcoming fight with Thordak. With time running out until the climactic battle, the party decides to travel to the Elemental Plane of Fire in search of the final Vestige, but find themselves in over their heads...
1	75	Guided by their bizarre new acquaintance, Vox Machina meets with the fire giant who is in possession of the Plate of the Dawnmartyr. Although their goal is literally in sight, retrieving the final Vestige might be one of their most perilous challenges yet.
1	76	Vox Machina finds themselves face to face with Ghurrix the pit fiend, leading to an all-out battle in the middle of the City of Brass.
1	77	Vox Machina returns from the Elemental Plane of Fire, only to discover Fort Daxio under siege. With no word from Allura, they rush into battle to save as many of their allies as they can.
1	78	Having gathered their allies, Vox Machina heads for the center of Emon to begin the final battle against Thordak the Cinder King.

1	91	Vox Machina descend into the Nine Hells and enter the City of Dis to find and destroy Hotis once and for all.
1	92	After Keyleth scares off her would-be attackers, Vox Machina continues their trek through the City of Dis, and Percy makes a deal with the devil Ipkesh to assassinate Utugash. Their mission takes them to the pit fiend's abode, where they also encounter and rescue a new ally in Tova. Will they fulfill the deal, or will Percy's soul be forfeit?
